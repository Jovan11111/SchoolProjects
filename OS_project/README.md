# OS Project
This project aims to develop a simple kernel with asynchronous time-sharing capabilities and implement C & C++ APIs for multithreading, semaphores, and memory allocation. It was created as part of the Operating Systems 1 course.

## Overview
The project focuses on building a basic kernel with asynchronous time-sharing functionality, allowing multiple tasks to run concurrently. Additionally, it provides APIs for essential operating system functionalities, including multithreading, semaphores for synchronization, and memory allocation.

## Features
Kernel Implementation: The project includes the development of a simple kernel with asynchronous time-sharing capabilities.

Multithreading API: The C & C++ APIs enable developers to create and manage multiple threads within the kernel, allowing for concurrent execution of tasks.

Semaphore Support: Semaphore APIs are provided for synchronization purposes, allowing threads to coordinate access to shared resources.

Memory Allocation: The project offers memory allocation APIs to manage dynamic memory allocation within the kernel, facilitating efficient memory utilization.
